Scaling is a luxury problem and surprisingly has more to do with organization than implementation. For each change we addressed the next order of magnitude of users we needed to support, starting in the thousands and now we’re designing for the hundreds of millions.  We identify our bottlenecks and addressed them as simply as possible by introducing clear integration points in our infrastructure to divide and conquer each problem individually.\r\n  - [From a monolithic Ruby on Rails app to the JVM](http://www.slideshare.net/pcalcado/from-a-monolithic-ruby-on-rails-app-to-the-jvm)\r\n  - [Building Products at SoundCloud - Part I: Dealing with the Monolith](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/building-products-at-soundcloud-part-1-dealing-with-the-monolith)\r\n  - [Building Products at SoundCloud - Part II: Breaking the Monolith](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/building-products-at-soundcloud-part-2-breaking-the-monolith)\r\n  - [Building Products at SoundCloud - Part III: Microservices in Scala and Finagle](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/building-products-at-soundcloud-part-3-microservices-in-scala-and-finagle)\r\n\r\n### Gilt\r\n\r\n- [Scaling Gilt: from Monolithic Ruby Application to Distributed Scala Micro-Services Architecture](http://www.slideshare.net/InfoQ/scaling-gilt-from-monolithic-ruby-application-to-distributed-scala-microservices-architecture) and here is [Gilt Case stady from Typesafe](http://downloads.typesafe.com/website/casestudies/Gilt-Live-Case-Study-v1.3.pdf)\r\n  - [Interview With Eric Bowman of Gilt.com](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/interview-with-eric-bowman-of-giltcom--net-35653)\r\n  - [How Gilt's Insane Traffic Spikes Pushed It Off Rails To Scala](http://readwrite.com/2014/05/08/gilt-eric-bowman-interview-scala-rails-jvm-reactive-platform)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Others\r\n- [Quora - Does Ruby on Rails scale?](http://www.quora.com/Does-Ruby-on-Rails-scale) ask long time ago - 2013\r\n- YellowPages\r\n- [Book - Enterprise Rails](http://dan.chak.org/enterprise-rails)\r\n- [Phusion Passenger Design and Architecture](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Design%20and%20Architecture.html)\r\n- [Deployment with Ruby on Rails](http://www.slideshare.net/jweiss/deployment-with-ruby-on-rails)\r\n- [Deploying And Monitoring Rails](http://www.slideshare.net/jweiss/deploying-and-monitoring-rails)\r\n- [Why Do They Say Rails Doesn't Scale?](http://codefol.io/posts/why-do-they-say-rails-doesnt-scale)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
