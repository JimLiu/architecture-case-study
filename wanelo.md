### Case Study
Very detailed case study.

#### Data matters the most
- Relational Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL
  - High consistency, reliability, decades of research,
great performance, gets tricky at mega-scale
- BigTable based: MongoDB, HBase
  - Eventual consistency, recent, have indexes, almost table-like. Also tricky at mega scale.
- Amazon Dynamo like: RIAK, Voldemort
  - Distributed hash-table, tricky from the very
beginning.

#### What to choose?
- Without a strong reason otherwise, choose a relational database. I prefer PostgreSQL.
- Instagram scaled on PostgreSQL very well
- If under pressure and in doubt, itâ€™s OK to choose whatever you are familiar with
