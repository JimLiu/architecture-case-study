### Case Study

#### Fun Facts
- Over 100 web, 40 memcache servers
- ~500 million requests/day to Rails app
- 98% cache hit rate
- ~240,000 memcache gets/sec
- ~20 billion memcache gets/day

#### Not Fun Facts
- Test suite takes ~10 hours
- Jenkins parallelized across 20 EC2 instances, takes ~20 min

We have a huge Rails app
- 300+ models, 200 controllers
- 20+ JVM services
- Some services do over a billion requests per day

> but we still have a huge Rails app

**SOA Service tradeoffs**:
- Handle unavailability
- Transactions arenâ€™t free
- APIs are much harder to change
- There are no atomic deploys


> - Always reevaluate your costs and their viability.

> - Be ready to be wrong


- **Q1: What should I extract out into a service?**
  - Things that...
  - Have little state or don't mutate sate
  - Are new enough to not be tightly coupled
  - Don't exist yet
  - Hard to extract, but about to kill you


- **Q2: Not everything work well ...**
  - We A/B test everything
  - Performance issues, tech debt
  - Experiments service


- **Q3: Why not a service?**
  - The problems we thought we had weren't as bad as we thought
  - We haven't solved the date prisoner problem yet
  - Service can be an excuse to start over
