### Case Study

We recently completed a year-long project to migrate Grouponâ€™s U.S. web traffic from a **monolithic Ruby on Rails** application to a new **Node.js** stack with substantial results.

We are not using Nginx, switched to Vert.x. It's much easier to write extension and custom routing.

Also, we are using [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/).

#### The original Rails architecture

#### Extended Architecture

#### Going Global

#### Mobile

### Split each major feature of the website into a separate web application

### Routing layer

### Single federated API layer that serves both our web and mobile apps

### Still need to support two backends

### Video Notes

Here are note to [JavaZone I-Tier: Breaking Up the Monolith, by Brian McCalliser][JavaZone]

Groupon failed with those Rails monolith architecture
- Could not build feature fast enough
- Wanted to build features worldwide
- Mobile and web lacked features parity
- We are stuck

#### Implemented Layout service for storing and providing layout for different micro-apps:

#### Layout Service in/out:

##### Sample layout with placeholders:

#### Groupon has "nice" architecture for North America, but monolith for Europe and Asia:
