### Groupon

- [Groupon Architecture](https://engineering.groupon.com/2013/misc/i-tier-dismantling-the-monoliths/) We recently completed a year-long project to migrate Groupon’s U.S. web traffic from a monolithic Ruby on Rails application to a new Node.js stack with substantial results.

### SoundCloud

  - [Evolution of SoundCloud’s Architecture](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/evolution-of-soundclouds-architecture) This is a story of how we adapted our architecture over time to accomodate growth. Scaling is a luxury problem and surprisingly has more to do with organization than implementation. For each change we addressed the next order of magnitude of users we needed to support, starting in the thousands and now we’re designing for the hundreds of millions.  We identify our bottlenecks and addressed them as simply as possible by introducing clear integration points in our infrastructure to divide and conquer each problem individually.
