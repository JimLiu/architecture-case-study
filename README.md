# Architecture Case Studies

The main idea is to collect as much as possible different architecture-related case studies in one place.

Case studies might be different:
- Migration from one platform  to another (Ruby on Rails -> Java)
- Solving scalability issues
- Migration from one architecture to another
  - _E.g._ from Monolith to SOA/Micro services
- Introducing polyglot programming and/or polyglot data
